The New Mexico Socialist Rifle Association welcomes any working class, progressive, anarchist, socialist, communist, eco-warrior, animal liberator, anti-fascist, anti-racist, anti-capitalist, PoC, LGBTQ+, or anyone who is interested in learning about firearms and all forms of self and community defense. 

We keep us safe.

We stand against the disarmament of the working class.

We are dedicated to arming the working class, both physically and mentally.
